  The rise of AI-powered Voice Interfaces (on the web)
summary:
  Discover the exciting potential of Voice User Interfaces on the web, now enhanced with AI. Join me as we explore features and learn how to create your own Jarvis (or KIT for the older crowd)! We'll revisit some cool web APIs, mix them with AI, and make an awesome Voice experience!

  How can I improve the way someone interacts with ChatGPT? How can I make it feel more natural than a dreadful “chatbot”? Can I create something cool? Those were some of the questions I asked myself recently while building an AI-powered chat interface. I’ll take you through what I build, how, and most importantly, why.
