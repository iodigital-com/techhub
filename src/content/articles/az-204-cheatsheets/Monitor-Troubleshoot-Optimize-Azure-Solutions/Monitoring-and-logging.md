## Application Insights

- Request rates, response times, and failure rates
- Dependency rates, response times, and failure rates
- Exceptions
- Page views and load performance
- Performance counters
- Host diagnostics
- Diagnostic trace logs
- Custom events and metrics

Ways to get started monitoring and analyzing app performance:

- **At run time**: without change in code
- **At development time**: add to code
- **Instrument your web pages** (client-side telemetry)
- **Analyze mobile app usage** (Visual Studio App Center)
- **Availability tests**: ping regularly from azure servers

## log-based metrics

- **log-based metrics**: **_Kusto queries_** from stored events (require processing to produce the result)
- **Standard metrics**: pre-aggregated time series. (near real time)

## Availability test

Up to 100 availability tests per Application Insights resource

- URL ping test (classic): relies on the DNS infrastructure of the public internet
- Standard test (Preview):
- Custom TrackAvailability test: use `TrackAvailability()` method to send data to Application Insight
- Multi-step test: Only available from visual studio , multi request or authentication test scenarios (Custom TrackAvailability works as well)

## Application Map

Troubleshoot app performance

- Components are different from "observed" external dependencies such as SQL, Event Hubs, etc. which your team/organization may not have access to (code or telemetry).
- Components run on any number of server/role/container instances.
- Components can be separate Application Insights instrumentation keys (even if subscriptions are different) or different roles reporting to a single Application Insights instrumentation key.

Progressive discovery of the components

## Alert type

- **Metric alert**: Metric data is stored in the system already **pre-computed**. Metric alerts are useful when you want to be **alerted** about data that requires little or no manipulation. We recommend using metric alerts if the data you want to monitor is available in metric data. (**stateful - only notifying once when alert is fired and once when alert is resolved**)

- **Log alert**: Log alerts allow you to perform **advanced logic operations** on your data. (KQL for data manipulation using log alerts).
- **Activity Log alert**: Activity logs provide auditing of all actions that occurred on resources. Use activity log alerts to be alerted when a **specific event happens** to a resource, for example, a restart, a shutdown, or the creation or deletion of a resource. (Stateless)
- **Prometheus alerts (preview)**: Prometheus alerts are primarily used for alerting on performance and health of Kubernetes clusters (including AKS).
