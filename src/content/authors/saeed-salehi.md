Saeed is a T-Shaped Back-end developer with hands-on experience in .Net Core and C# that tries to solve problems differently 😁
A.K.A software engineer 🧑‍💻, maybe a geek 🤓 and all-around debugger 🪲

He believes that sharing what we build, how we build it, and the mistakes we made along the way improves the experience and saves time for the next thousands of people doing similar. For the same reasons 🤘
