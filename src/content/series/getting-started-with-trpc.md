summary: "There's nothing quite like the feeling of finally getting your front-end and back-end types to match up. After hours of slacking, emailing, and going through documentation, you finally have it! But that feeling doesn't last long, because you realize the back-end had some type changes, which broke your front-end again! Well, here is where tRPC comes into play."
