Details: Getting Your Axe On - Event Sourcing with Axon Framework In this presentation, we will explore the basics of event-driven architecture using Axon Framework. We'll start by explaining key concepts such as Event Sourcing and Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS), and how they can improve the scalability and maintainability of modern applications. You will learn what Axon Framework is, how it simplifies implementing these patterns, and see hands-on examples of setting up a project with Axon Framework and Spring Boot. Whether you are new to these concepts or looking to understand them more, this session will provide practical insights and tools to help you build resilient and efficient applications. Event-Driven Microservices - Beyond the Fairy Tale Our applications need to be faster, better, bigger, smarter, and more enjoyable to meet our demanding end-users needs. In recent years, the way we build, run, and operate our software has changed significantly. We use scalable platforms to deploy and manage our applications. Instead of big monolithic deployment applications, we now deploy small, functionally consistent components as microservices. Problem. Solved. Right? Unfortunately, for most of us, microservices, and especially their event-driven variants, do not deliver on the beautiful, fairy-tale-like promises that surround them.In this session, Allard will share a different take on microservices. We will see that not much has changed in how we build software, which is why so many “microservices projects” fail nowadays. What lessons can we learn from concepts like DDD, CQRS, and Event Sourcing to help manage the complexity of our systems? He will also show how message-driven communication allows us to focus on finding the boundaries of functionally cohesive components, which we can evolve into microservices should the need arise.","venue":{"name":"iO | Digital agency | Utrecht","address":"Boven Clarenburg 2","postalCode":"3511 JJ","city":"Utrecht","country":"nl"},"eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/coven-of-wisdom-utrecht/events/303071752","dateTime":"2024-09-19T18:00+02:00","endTime":"2024-09-19T20:00+02:00","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","groupName":"Coven of Wisdom - Utrecht"},{"title":"The Leadership Meetup","description":"PLEASE RSVP SO THAT WE KNOW HOW MUCH FOOD WE WILL NEED What distinguishes a software developer from a software team lead?

Brecht De Ruyte - The future of UI is \"open\" When dealing with more advanced UI elements there are a lot of things that go wrong. They impact performance, accessibility and have the tendency to create frustrations along the way. In this talk, I will be introducing you to the W3C community around Open UI, while also taking a little detour with the Anchoring API. By combining these future specs we'll take a peek at the future of styling custom UI by only using HTML and CSS, giving you less frustration, performance boosts and basic accessibility out of the box. As a bonus, we'll also have a little look at selectlist and exclusive accordions. Tim Dujardin - Why semantics matter Are you developing forms without labels? Is the < div > element your go-to element to provide 'structure' in your website or web application? Do you make use of < a href=\"#\" > to create actionable elements? In this talk, I will guide you through accessible design, development and testing by exposing common misconceptions and how to handle them correctly in the future.

They have been available to us for a while now, but don’t get used as much as they should. Custom properties are more than just a constant; they are flexible and smart. We’ll be styling 4 buttons with less than 20 lines of code, learning to take more control of a grid by using smart variables, and adding some JavaScript trickery as a finishing touch. After Brecht has taught us how to optimise our design systems using custom properties, Hidde will take our hand and lead us further on our design system journey, on a deep dive into popovers and how to build them.

Our focus will be on three groundbreaking upgrades: String Templates (String Interpolation) for streamlined string manipulation, Unnamed Classes/Methods to eliminate redundant code, and Pattern Matching for simplified conditional checks. Witness how these features empower developers to craft more expressive, concise, and maintainable code, leading to enhanced productivity and top-notch software quality. Don't miss out on this chance to explore the forefront of Java development! Going native with Spring Boot 3 One of the main new features provided with the latest major releases of Spring Boot and the Spring Framework is support for native compilation with GraalVM. With this, we can build native executables that run directly on the OS, without a JVM. This results in very fast startup times and vastly reduced memory usage, opening up all sorts of new use cases for Java-based applications.

He will take you on a fun journey on how he created a multi-user and real-time progressive web app. But be aware, there is a guest list and not every solution is invited to join the party! Dave will show you how the Remix friend group will keep your party rocking: Where the state of your data is on the server where it belongs. (load some data and take action to get the party started). Where this multi-user web app is not dependent on complex client-side JavaScript (so even your drunk friend will understand it) Where the client-side is less error-prone (no party fouls wanted) Where the components are just plain stupid (no good story starts with a glass of milk) Where your application becomes simple and easy to understand (you know, for that friend) Dave will tell you about the challenges he encountered building this web app and how it was solved charmingly by using Remix. He will show you how Remix can be used for web apps with a lot of interactivity, not just for plain websites with an occasional form. Getting FOMO?

And because of the continuous development and improvement of 3D aspects, more and more is possible. Examples are viewing the interior of your new car before buying it, configuring your own bookshelf, and even viewing an accurate and detailed representation of the universe. In this talk, Michael will explain the impact of 3D on our shopping patterns. And thus what this means for e-commerce. He will highlight topics such as the various implementations of 3D in e-commerce and when 3D has the most impact (and when it doesn’t). In addition, he will share some of his own experiences. After the talk, Michael will be happy to answer all your 3D e-commerce or web-related questions. Eddy Vinck - Getting Started with Remix and a Headless CMS Does the thought of writing your own server scare you? Grabbing a headless CMS to generate those static files? I definitely used to think servers are scary. But not anymore. With Remix, you don’t run into problems when your brochure websites eventually evolve into something bigger and more complex — without the workarounds of a static website. When your server renders your front-end, you can integrate as many services as you like, or write it all yourself: it’s completely up to you. All without drowning your users in request waterfalls. In this talk, I will show you how to integrate a headless CMS into your Remix projects to provide great authoring- and user experiences.","venue":{"name":"iO Campus Eindhoven","address":"Marconilaan 16","postalCode":"meetup5","city":"Eindhoven","country":"nl"},"eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/coven-of-wisdom-eindhoven/events/284350991","dateTime":"2022-03-24T18:00+01:00","endTime":"2022-03-24T21:00+01:00","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","groupName":"Coven of Wisdom - Eindhoven"},{"title":"Container Queries and Functional Programming","description":"After a very nice insight on Remix, by Kent C Dodds.

These developers are also now some of the highest paid in the entire trade.

These techniques also matured frontend development, making it more accessible to developers with a non-frontend background. Despite all the new programming patterns and code abstractions, the frontend still runs in JavaScript, a language with its … quirks. The language has improved significantly since 2015 and each year, new features are added. In this webinar we’ll discuss how to utilise these (and existing) features and write more readable modern JavaScript. Who is this webinar for? Any developer with a little or a lot of experience in any language who wants to learn more about JavaScript. This webinar is the first of two and focusses on where JavaScript is different from other languages and which important features are added in the last 5 years. The host Abbe Keultjes is a senior frontend developer who works at Frontmen, part of Intracto. He specialises in JavaScript, (S)CSS and Angular with 13+ years of experience.","venue":{"name":"Online event","address":"","postalCode":"","city":"","country":""},"eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/coven-of-wisdom-utrecht/events/270309249","dateTime":"2020-04-30T13:00+02:00","endTime":"2020-04-30T14:00+02:00","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","groupName":"Coven of Wisdom - Utrecht"},{"title":"Webinar | GraphQL Workshop (free)","description":"======== MAXIMUM NUMBER OF REGISTRATIONS REACHED ======== Hi, Thanks for the interest in our GraphQL Webinar!

This aims to provide immediate feedback but test duration is often the bottleneck. In this presentation, Bo will describe how we use AWS lambda and other services to run tests in parallel and accelerate test execution. He will also talk about integrating the tests into Continuous Delivery pipeline in Jenkins. Take away: • Apply Micro Service to test architecture • Running test on AWS lambda • Continuous Delivery pipeline with Jenkins Bo Wang works at Albelli as a Senior Quality Engineer. With 16 years of experience in software testing, he has a background in telecommunications, banking and E-commerce domains. Bo has extensive experience in both Web API and Web UI tests; he focuses on test automation and Continuous Testing in Agile teams. Common Pitfalls in Automated Frontend Testing - Giovanni Rago As part of the industry's shift left trend, automated UI testing has been a staple in many organizations’ QA effort for several years now. Whether fully integrated as automated quality gate in a continuous delivery pipeline, or just as a set of nightly runs, UI test suites still pose a challenge to many organizations. In this talk, Giovanni will discuss: • Sticking points big and small, organizations are reporting from the field • Best practices on how to avoid them • These will range from the technical to the more strategic, with examples presented when possible. Giovanni Rago is a Solutions Engineer at Sauce Labs EMEA. Giovanni is responsible for providing in-depth technical advice to customers about how to be successful with their automation and CI/CD efforts. His previous roles involved leading Customer Success, Support and Test Automation during which he has implemented automated tests at multiple different companies. Load testing at Albelli - Denys Ulyanov • What happens at Albelli during Black Friday? • What is the load we expect? • What are the business concerns? • What are the technical challenges? • How are we solving them? These are some of the questions Denys tries to answer with his presentation of Load Testing. He'll describe the different solutions tried and explain the reasons behind choosing what is currently used. Denys Ulyanov is a Quality engineer at Albelli with more than 10 years of experience in test automation. During his career, he has worked for e-commerce, game industry, and the American health care industry developing solutions for Obama Care.

We start at 18:00 with food and drinks and at 19:00 we start the first talk with: Rafael Fernandes on Service Worker Crash Course. So you've heard about service workers, progressive web apps, how they're the \"next big thing\" for a lot of web developers and frontend developers and all that jazz… Well, I'm not gonna preach you the PWA gospel, but I will try to share my love for the emerging offline-first attitude. I'll be using a simple open source PW for this and show what is the code behind a generic service worker that will work for most scenarios, tell you how it works, hopefully teach you a few tricks and have you excited about implementing it in your projects. After that we have: Antoni Vives on Service Workers, the gotchas in your path to production. From the moment someone accesses your site the loading time is a critical factor. Statistics have proven to us that if it takes more than 3 seconds to load, you've already lost half of your users. Fortunately modern browsers offer different storage technologies to cache information so it only needs to be downloaded once from your network. This is the largest loading performance win you can implement today.We all know that caching is hard so this talk will cover the best practices and design patterns to make your caching strategies production ready. And the most important (and coolest thing) is that I'll demonstrate how to make them work together with one of the most cutting edge technologies for caching: service workers ! Then a quick drink again enjoying the scenery and the knowledge gained. See you on the 7th","venue":{"name":"Zamro","address":"Oosterdoksstraat 80","postalCode":"","city":"Amsterdam","country":"nl"},"eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/coven-of-wisdom-amsterdam/events/237315359","dateTime":"2017-02-07T18:00+01:00","endTime":"2017-02-07T18:00+01:00","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","groupName":"Coven of Wisdom - Amsterdam"},{"title":"Harry Roberts meetup!","description":"Get your ticket here: https://frontmen.eventbrite.nl (https://frontmen.eventbrite.nl/) Harry Roberts is a one-of-a-kind CSS architect and international speaker.

It can however be useful to have a quick look as it can give coders some nice features and developments are on a very fast pace here as well. This meetup offers you that quick look. Next to that you have a change of winning a full day workshop with Harry Roberts (https://twitter.com/csswizardry) as well, a Guru on this subject. This workshop will on the 22nd of November and we will raffle two free tickets under the attendees off this meetup. Back to the meetup itself, we start at 18:00 with food and drinks. At 19;00 the talks will start and we have: Kristijan Ristovski with: CSS in JS. Wait ... What?

Prashant will share his workflow on Chrome DevTools along with some handy tips and tricks.Some of the features that he will talk about are: Profiling load-time performance using network waterfall view Profiling runtime performance using timeline view Auditing web app for memory leaks Emulating networks and devices capabilities Staying productive with shortcuts Debugging in the DevTools David Ferreira with his talk about Web Components: In his daily work, David is working to merge several component libraries for frontend development into one central library, for a large enterprise. These components are being written in Angular Components, as they need to deliver ASAP the final product. However, David and his team are looking to implement Web Components in a near future. They want to use Webcomponents.JS polyfills only, so they can keep the application as clean and framework-agnostic as they can. So David has spent several hours a week investigating the usual suspects for a components library: Web Components. However some problems came up, and much more if we talk about old browsers compatibility. What David is going to share, are the difficulties he found dealing with the business, how to keep the application well structured and organized to start developing Web Components with ES6 and SASS, and how to implement quickly the 4 web components specifications: Custom elements; HTML Imports; Templates; Shadow DOM. Rafael Fernandes and Antoni Huguet Vives with their talk “Surviving to the offline status”: They are going to show the basic principles to design an application with a “thinking offline first” approach. To do that they will cover technologies like: Web workers; Service workers; IndexedDB. With this talk they want to give you a good overview about the future web standards for offline and low connectivity scenarios.","venue":{"name":"Werkspoorkathedraal","address":"Tractieweg 41","postalCode":"","city":"Utrecht","country":"nl"},"eventUrl":"https://www.meetup.com/coven-of-wisdom-amsterdam/events/231619347","dateTime":"2016-08-03T18:00+02:00","endTime":"2016-08-03T21:00+02:00","timezone":"Europe/Amsterdam","groupName":"Coven of Wisdom - Amsterdam"},{"title":"Join 2 Advanced JavaScript talks from Kyle Simpson at RTL (for free)","description":"We are still very proud to tell that Kyle Simpson is visiting FrontMen for a 3-day experience.
